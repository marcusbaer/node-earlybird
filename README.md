earlybird
==============

A quick and easy to setup web server for earlybird development and even more.

Installation
------------------

	npm install earlybird -g
	
Run
------------------

	cd /path/to/my/sources
	earlybird

Starting parameters overview
------------------

	p		a standard port different from 80
	www		a static assets path different from current directory

	s		set a service method script
	u		a service url prefix different from 'service' (http://localhost/service/demo)

	ws		use WebSockets by setting a sockets method script

	ssl		start with ssl support (on port 443)
	h		a host name different from localhost (for ssl)
	nohttp	do not run standard http server and start only https proxy listening on port `-p` (default is 80)

	a       set a basic auth user account given by `username:password`
	am      set a basic auth message

Usage of a service
------------------

To integrate a service, place a service script like this in your working directory and name it, e.g. `service.js`:

	var serviceCallback = function (serviceName, postData, callback) {
    	var responseData = {};
    	switch (serviceName) {
			// call with http://localhost/service/demo
			case 'demo':
				responseData = {demo: 'hello'};
				break;
    	}
		return responseData;
	};

	exports.service = serviceCallback;

Refer to this script by starting with `--s` parameter. Services have a special path in your url (default is http://localhost/service). If you'd like to set a different path name, start with `--u` parameter:

	earlybird --s=service --u=example/service		# run service with http://localhost/example/service

To call services from frontend you can copy `jquery.service.js` to your working directory. Adjust it to your needs and call it like that:

	$(document).ready(function() {
    	$.callService('demo', {}, function(response){
			// something inside the success callback..
    	});
	});

Or do something else.

WebSockets
------------------

To use WebSockets, install `socket.io` first (`npm install socket.io -g`). After that start earlybird server with `--ws` attribute.

	earlybird --ws=sockets

Calling services from frontend is shown in example as well.

	$(document).ready(function() {
    	$(document).initSocket(function(){
	        $(document).callSocket('hello', {id: '123'}, function (response) {
            	// something inside the socket callback..
        	});
    	});
	});

At the moment there are problems running WebSockets with SSL.

SSL support
------------------

To run earlybird server with ssl, install `http-proxy` first (`npm install http-proxy -g`) and start with `--ssl` parameter. Optionally set another host name with `--h`. SSL needs a (self-signed) ssl certificate. It has to be placed inside a folder named `ssl` in your working directory. Place here both files `localhost.key` and `localhost.cert`. Actually SSL is only supported on port 443.

	earlybird --ssl --h "abc.de"

Basic authentication
------------------

Content file types as images, audio or video files as well as JSON data can be protected by an simple basic authentication. It is also used for javascript files. Other file types like HTML or CSS/LESS can pass unauthorized.

To use earlybird server with basic auth, run with `--a` and a user/password combination seperated by a ":". A different auth message can be set by `--am`:

    earlybird --a username:password --am "Please tell me who you are"
